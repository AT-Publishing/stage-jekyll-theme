Bitcoin Diamond aims to create a cryptocurrency with better privacy options: "Encrypting the amount and balance to protect user privacy".

It has an optimized GPU mining algorithm X13 so it also fights the ASIC empire centralization. It has maximum block size of 8M and it supports segwit.

A major change is the total supply - there will be 210 mil Bitcoin Diamond coins which is ten times more than of the legacy Bitcoin. The team says it is done so that the single unit (1 coin) is not as overpriced as when the supply is limited severely.

Bitcoin Diamond is supported by 33 exchanges including Binance, OKEX, Huobi.Pro and Bit-Z and 6 wallets - BitGo, Bitpie, Coldlar and ATOKEN.
