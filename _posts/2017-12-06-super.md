> The expansion war in the past three years has severely hindered the development of the bitcoin technology. Bitcoin has lost a tremendous share of the cryptocurrency market given aggressive competition coming from the likes of Ethereum and Zcash. The bitcoin community has therefore gathered a group of enthusiasts and developers who share the goal to revitalize the bitcoin dominance.

The fork will take place at block height 498888, after which, new functionalities will be added to the forked chain. The original bitcoin holders will be compensated with one super BTC for every BTC held.

Block size will be expanded to 8MB per block. In 2018, the privacy features will be enhanced with zero-knowledge proof. Later, Turing complete smart contracts support will be added to scale to more functionalities.

There will be a pre-mine of 210,000 SBTC. The pre-mine will be used to fund the development.
