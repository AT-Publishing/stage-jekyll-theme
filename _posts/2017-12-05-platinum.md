Bitcoin Platinum is a Bitcoin fork with no pre-mine, block time decreased from 10 minutes to 2.5 minutes, GPU mining (Equihash) and Segwit2x.

Bitcoin Platinum uses blockchain technology to operate with no central governance or 3rd party interference; managing, issuing and maintaining bitcoins is carried out collectively by the decentralized network.

Bitcoin Platinum is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin Platinum and everyone can take part. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation, and decentralized development
