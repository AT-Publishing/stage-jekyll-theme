The original SegWit2X fork that was called off in November 2017 is happening after all.

[From the official website](http://b2x-segwit.io/?utm_source=forkitinfo):

> Our team will carry out the Bitcoin hard fork â€“ Segwit2X, which was expected in mid-November. At the same time, its futures trading is conducted on some exchanges, including HitBTC.

So once again, features of the SegWit2x:

* X11 encryption
* faster block generation
* 4MB blocks

In the roadmap for 2018:

* lightning network
* smart contracts
* zksnark
* transaction privacy

This time bitcoin holders should receive more than 1:1 ratio of their holdings: Jaap Terlouw says on the official homepage of SegWit2X they will also distribute a proportional amount of Satoshi's BTC equivalent.

Currently, SegWit2X futures trade on YoBit where [the forked coins will also be granted 1:1](https://twitter.com/YobitExchange/status/943138360570318848) on the new chain launch.
