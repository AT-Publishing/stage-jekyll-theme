Bitcoin Cash Plus is a Bitcoin fork to implement Equihash (GPU mining), SigHash, 8M blocks and EDA. In spite of the name, Bitcoin Cash Plus is a fork of the original Bitcoin, not of Bitcoin Cash.

All Bitcoin holders as of block 501407 are also owners of Bitcoin Cash Plus.

At the moment it is not known who is behind Bitcoin Cash Plus, whether there will be a development at all or what is the purpose of this fork. The domain name is registered for one year only, has privacy turned on and lives on a cheap shared host.

> Bitcoin Cash Plus brings sound money to the world, fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin as "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash". Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation, and decentralized development.
