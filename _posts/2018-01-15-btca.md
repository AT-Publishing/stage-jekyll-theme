The block number of the fork has still not been announced. You can follow the [announcement thread on bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2515675.0).

Futures can already be traded on YoBit, market data available from [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-atom/#markets).

#### Roadmap & features

* LN implementation, allowing for instant off-chain atomic swaps
* Both PoW and PoS, increasing network stability and reducing the power of miners
